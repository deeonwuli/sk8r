i'm using react and tailwind-css to build a dress up game. a dress up game is basically a character generator where the user chooses between hairstyles, skin color, eyes, nose, mouth, and other character defining features in order to create a unique character. 

i started this project using create-react-app and i'm figuring it out as i go. if you want to keep up with my flops as i push to staging, visit https://sk8r-girl.herokuapp.com/
